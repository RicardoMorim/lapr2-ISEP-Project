>
> **Answer:** The name of the profession: Gardener, Paver, Electrician, Operator, ...

> **Question:** What is the acceptance criteria when are creating a job that already exists and what does the system do?
>
> **Answer:** By definition a set canÂ´t have duplicates. Assuring no duplicates is not a business rule is a technical issue.

> **Question:** Is it relevant to associate a specific area or sector with each Job? (For example, "Gardener" would be inserted in the "Maintenance" sector)
> 
> **Answer:**  it is not necessary to the extent that there are no US to suggest that it might ever be necessary

> **Question:** Should you include information such as salary, type of hire (full-time or part-time), and type of work (face-to-face, remote or hybrid) in the Job? Or does this information fit better within the scope of the employee, or maybe it's not even necessary?
>

>we do not need other attributes such as below:

>2. Job category : for classifying jobs like gardening, drivers, administration employees , etc
>3. Job Skills: for assigning qualified employee/collaborator in future (having same qualities and skills)
>or other attributes...
>
> **Answer:** I'll repeat:
>a job is just the job name!
>1. Don't know what means job ID, because in the client perspective, a job is just the job name;
