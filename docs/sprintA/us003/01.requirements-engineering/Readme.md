# US003 - Register a collaborator and characteristics


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an organization employee, I want to create a new task in order to be further published.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

>	Each task is characterized by having a unique reference per organization, a designation, an informal and a technical description, an estimated duration and cost, as well as a task category. 

>	As long as it is not published, access to the task is exclusive to the employees of the respective organization. 

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** When creating a collaborator with an existing name, what does the system do?
>
> **Answer:** It's not common and most improbable to have different individual with same name in the same context, however itâ€™s ID documentation number should be unique for sure.

> **Question:** What characteristics are important to success the register?
>
> **Answer:** I believe that question was already answered, name, birthdate, admission date, id doc type, id doc number, contact info (email, mobile), address.

> **Question:** Which information is mandatory to insert a collaborator in the program (fundamental characteristics)?
>
> **Answer:** Name, birth date, admission date, address, contact info (mobile and email), taxpayer number, ID doc type and respective number.

> **Question:** Does the HRM select the job from a list that we display?
>
> **Answer:** Displaying or not, It's a matter of UX, the dev team should decide about it, but the valid jobs are the ones created within the US02.
